X could be all/first half/last 10%/a specific row or column/10% of the matrix/etc.
Y can be whatever is contained inside the matrix/function/etc.

Start from a streamliner and see if it can be inferred from the nogoods.

----------------------Potential Streamliners-----------------------
X of the matrix/function/etc is higher/lower/equal/etc. than Y
X of the matrix is odd/even
X of the matrix is monotonically increasing/decreasing (No need if there is lex already)
Function is commutative/associative/etc.
First/Last element is smallest/largest
